			A Melbourne woman, whose mum caught coronavirus from the city's hardest-hit aged care home, has detailed the horrific situation the family were left in.

			Angela Vukovic’s 81-year-old mother Chrysanthi was in St Basil’s, in the north Melbourne suburb of Fawkner, until late last week.

			St Basil’s has lost nine residents to coronavirus and 80 others have been evacuated from the home and taken to hospital.

			Ms Vukovic told ABC’s 7.30 her mum was one of the first residents to test positive.

			“I have been crying for days. We know COVID is basically a killer for the elderly,” Ms Vukovic told the ABC program.

			“She was one of the first few that tested positive. My mother was at the end of the building. No-one could hear her. She was screaming her lungs out for someone to come and help her.”

			Eventually Ms Vukovic managed to get onto a COVID specialist in the building and her 81-year-old mum Chrysanthi was transported to hospital. Chrysanthi was severely dehydrated and needed oxygen when she arrived at hospital over the weekend but is slowly recovering from the virus.

			Victoria today recorded 295 new coronavirus cases and nine new deaths – and although the drop in case numbers is good news, the level of community transmission is causing health authorities concern. 

			Two people in the 90s, five in their 80s, one in their 70s and one in their 60s have died from the coronavirus in Victoria overnight. Seven of those nine are from aged care homes. There are now 307 Victorians in hospital, 41 in intensive care.
